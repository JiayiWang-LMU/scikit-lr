# Rank aggregation in the PLR problem

## Description
The following new scripts have been added and can be tested using `ra_test.py`:
- `ra.py`, which provides the MC4 and ML algorithms for aggregating the pair order matrix.
- `ra_mc4.py`
- `ra_ml.py`

Additionally, the original `_forest.py` file in the `ensemble` directory has been modified.
